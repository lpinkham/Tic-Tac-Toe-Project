README file for my Tic Tac Toe project.

TIC TAC TOE

Objective:
To build a tic tac toe game that a single user can play online. Users should be
able to log-in, change password, log out and a see summary of games played.

The game must be built as a single-page application.

Technologies and skills needed to compete:
- Javascript
- Command Line
- Git
- Git Hub
- HTML
- CSS/SASS
- jQuery
- API
- AJAX
- DOM

Bugs and Fixes:
- There are bug in the game over logic that need to be worked out.
- The UI needs some updating.
- Still need to show the user a summary of the games played.

To play:
The first player, which will be X every game, clicks in a square to place their
x on the board. The game will then switch to the player O's turn and they will
place an O in a square on the board. This will continue until either someone
gets three in a row or all squares are full and no one has won the game.
