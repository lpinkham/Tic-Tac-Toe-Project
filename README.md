README file for my Tic Tac Toe project built by Lori Pinkham

TIC TAC TOE

OBJECTIVE:

To build a tic tac toe game that a single user can play online. In addition to playing a game a user should be able to log-in, change password, log out and a see summary of games played.

The game must be built as a single-page application.

TECHNOLOGIES AND SKILLS USED:
- HTML
- CSS/SASS
- Javascript
- Git / Git Hub
- jQuery
- API


DEVELOPMENT PROCESS:

My development process began with writing some users stories and create a wireframe. Once those were completed I created a simple html file so I could start writing the code to connect to the API for all of the user authentication. After the connection with the API was completed I begin writing the javascript for the game logic. Pseudo code came first then writing the javascript code.  The code included testing for a winner, populating the squares with the X's and O's, making the squares non-clickable once a square has been clicked on and keeping track of all the games. The last part was to do some work on the UI.

PROBLEM SOLVNG STATEGIES:

To assist with solving some of my challenges while building this was to console.log a lot during the testing process. Another way I was able to solve problems was to focus on only changing one function or piece of code at a time and to test it after even just some minor chnages.

TO PLAY:

The first player, which will be X every game, clicks in a square to place their x on the board. The game will then switch to the player O's turn and they will place an O in a square on the board. This will continue until either someone gets three in a row or all squares are full and no one has won the game.

USER STORIES AND WIREFRAMES:

  1. As a user, I want to be able to play a game of tic tac toe.
  2. As a user, I want to be able to login and play a game of tic tac toe.
  3. As someone who likes to play online games I would like to be able to keep track of how many times I play and win tic tac toe.
  4. As a user I would like to be able to play a game of tic tac toe and be able to save a game that I may not have time to finish playing. Also, it is important to me to know how many times I have played the game and won.

FUTURE ITERATIONS:

In the future I would like to spend some time cleaning up the UI.
